        <p><strong>The higher competition in the banking industry has pushed the banks to increase their profitability 
            and marketing efficiency. Since the bank marketing campaigns are dependent on customersÂ´ data, performing data analysis allows extracting 
            the unseen information from the data that could help in the decision-making process.
        </strong></p>
        <br>

        <p>Extracting information from the features in the dataset related to the client's data, information of the last contact of the current and previous 
            campaign, several interesting findings will help enhance marketing effectiveness. Concerning the customer's data,
            the most important features that need to be used for the next marketing campaigns are the age, balance, and loan status of the potential customers.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since potential customers' age has a wide range, grouping them into several categories is simplifying the feature interpretation. 
            The age groups are divided into 20 to 60. According to the figure of term deposit subscription by age group below, 
            it is seen that the age group of 30 was the most that received the call from telemarketers. However, the positive subscription ratio was achieved by the age group of 20 and 60. 
            This means that <strong>the youngest and eldest potential customers will most likely subscribe to term deposits</strong> in this bank.
        </p><br>

        <center><img src="../static/plot1.png" width="720" height="291"><br><br></center><br>

        <p>If the age is compared to the balance, there is no clear pattern found. In this bank, some youngsters who have a balance of more than 20000 Euro.
            On the other hand, there is a lot of elders that have a small amount of balance. The balance feature itself is grouped into four groups, no balance,
            low balance, average balance, and high balance. Most of the population falls into the low balance group. This group, however, had a negative subcriber
            conversion ratio. As expected, <strong>the groups that have more interest in subscribing to term deposits are the average and high balance groups</strong> with ratios of
            about 55% and 57%, respectively.
        </p>
        <br>

        <br>

        <p>Again, comparing balance with other features is somehow interesting. If the balance feature is compared to the campaign (the number of contacts 
            performed during this campaign for the same potential customer) and the duration of the last call, it is surprising that the potential customers who 
            have low balance are the ones that received the offer most. It contradicts with the fact that people with average and high balance will be more interested 
            to subscribe to a term deposit. Furthermore, a takeaways from the figure of balance against duration is, longer duration tends to have higher probability of 
            conversion. Then, <strong>the telemarketers should gain more engagement to the potential customers who have an average and high balance to increase the chance of successfully 
            selling term deposits.</strong>
        </p>

        <center><img src="../static/plot6.png" width="702" height="386"><br><br></center>

        <p>Correlating the number of contacts that have been performed and its duration with the potential customers' decision making the analysis more interesting. It can be said that:
            
            <center><br><strong><i>"Potential customers tend to refuse the offer after about received 5 calls, unless the call duration is high"</i></strong></center><br>
            
            The more the calls to potential clients within the same marketing campaign, the more likely potential customers will refuse to open a term deposit. They should first assess 
            whether a potential customer is interested in the offer in the first place. After the third call, the probability that a potential client will refuse to subscribe to a term 
            deposit increases drastically by approximately 5%. Thus, three calls can be a threshold for telemarketers to approach one potential customer. As the number of calls reaches 
            the threshold, then the telemarketers may evaluate whether the customer is still interested or not.  
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Just keep in mind that the more calls the telemarketer makes to a potential client in a shorter period of time, the more irritated the potential client will be.</strong> 
            Thus, it leads to a higher level of probability for the potential client to refuse the offer.
        </p>

        <center><img src="../static/plot5.png" width="658" height="332"><br><br></center>

        <p><i>Are having either a housing loan or a personal loan affecting potential customers' decision to subscribe to a term deposit?</i><br> Based on the plots below, the potential 
            customers who do not have a housing loan are more interested in subscribing to a term deposit. The ratio of term deposit subscribers with no housing loan is 60%, 
            compared to those who have a housing loan that only about 36%. This means, <strong>having a housing loan is really affecting the decision to subscribe.</strong> This makes sense 
            since people who have a housing loan should spare their money to pay the mortgage installment instead of depositing their money in the bank. By contrast, a personal 
            loan does not affect the potential customer's decision.
        </p>

        <p>Finally, the marketing team should also consider the timing of the marketing throughout the year. The current campaign's highest marketing effectiveness ratio was achieved in 
            March, September, October, and December. The effectiveness ratio in March and December is even up to 80%. It concludes that <b>increasing marketing activity during these months 
            for the next campaign will probably increase the lead conversion ratio.</b>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        
        <p><center><b><i>By performing a more targeted marketing campaign with several strategies that are already mentioned, <br>the goals of increasing bank direct marketing effectiveness 
            and gaining capital of the bank are more feasible to achieve.</i></b></center>
