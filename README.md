<h2>Bank Direct Marketing Effectiveness</h2>

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns. 
The Portuguese Bank had run a telemarketing campaign in the past, making sales calls for a term-deposit product. 
Often, more than one contact to the same client was required to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
Then, the marketing team wants to launch another campaign, and they want to learn from the past one to increase the marketing effectiveness.
